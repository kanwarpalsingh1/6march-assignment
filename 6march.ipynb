    "Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics involves methods for summarizing and describing the features of a dataset. Examples include calculating measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median, mode) and measures of variability (e.g., standard deviation, range). Descriptive statistics might be used to summarize the exam scores of students in a class.\n",

    "Inferential Statistics: Inferential statistics involves making inferences or predictions about a population based on a sample of data. Examples include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis. Inferential statistics might be used to determine if a new drug is effective in treating a particular medical condition by comparing the outcomes of patients who received the drug with those who received a placebo."

    "\n",
    "ans:-Nominal Data: Nominal data consists of categories or labels without any inherent order. Examples include gender (male, female), eye color (blue, brown, green), and marital status (single, married, divorced). Nominal data can be represented using words, letters, or numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Data: Ordinal data represents categories with a natural order or ranking. However, the intervals between categories are not necessarily equal. Examples include education level (high school, college, graduate), socioeconomic status (low, middle, high), and Likert scale responses (strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree).\n",

    "Interval Data: Interval data represents numerical values where the difference between any two values is meaningful and consistent. However, there is no true zero point. Examples include temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit, and years (e.g., 2000, 2001, 2002). In interval data, mathematical operations such as addition and subtraction can be performed, but multiplication and division are not meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ratio Data: Ratio data is similar to interval data, but it has a true zero point, indicating the absence of the quantity being measured. Examples include height, weight, and income. In ratio data, all arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are meaningful."

    "\n",
    "For example, if we have data on the heights of students in a class, we need to know if the data is measured at the interval or ratio level. If it is measured at the interval level (e.g., in Celsius), we can calculate measures such as the mean height of the students. However, if the data is measured at the ratio level (e.g., in centimeters), we can also calculate ratios such as the height of one student relative to another."

It provides a visual summary of the distribution of a dataset by showing the median, quartiles, and any potential outliers. The \"box\" in the plot represents the interquartile range (IQR), while the \"whiskers\" extend to the minimum and maximum values within a certain range or a specified number of standard deviations from the median."
